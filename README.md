# nonogram_simplified
In this program, I will take into consideration a simplified version of nonograms, in which each row or column contains at most 1 block of black squares (so only one number is needed to describe a row or column, 0 meaning no blocks). The program will contain a function that takes as input a list of 0/1 integers and a natural number D (the length of the block), and returns the minimum number of bit flipping operations required to obtain a sequence of ones of length D surrounded by zeros (or adjacent to the ends of the list).

To run all tests: python validator.py zad4 python main.py
